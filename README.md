# Stack Toggle

This is such a dumb little mod I started making for no particular reason, but now it's starting to grow on me. It lets you toggle item stacking on or off in the inventory. I saw [this other mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/items-dont-stack) one day and started to play with the idea.

I guess it has *some* usefulness, for example to pick items out of stack of ammo parts or something. Stuff you'd normally use that little window in the bottom middle of the inventory screen for.

You can toggle item stacking using a button and/or keybind (SHIFT + LEFT ALT). You can enable/disable either in MCM. You can also move the button around and force certain item types (bolts, patches, etc.) to always stack. You can add your own to the list pretty easily with a little bit of code.

Installation order shouldn't matter.
